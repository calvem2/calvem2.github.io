                I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Washington, graduating in June 2021.
                I'm passionate about using my technical background to build effective technologies through collaboration
                and communication with diverse teams and populations.

                At UW, I serve as an officer for the school's chapter of Girls Who Code. I have been an officer since the club was founded in 2018.
                Girls Who Code aims to provide a safe, supportive community for those who might not feel like they belong in STEM. As a mixed race woman in
                computer science, I have loved having the opportunity to help foster an inclusive environment and to learn from the rich perspectives of the Girls Who Code community.

                Outside of school, I am a house plant fanatic. I don't really know what I'm doing most of the time and those groups on Facebook
                dedicated to finding $300 rare plants scare me, but I love taking care of my lil collection of leafy friends. Fun fact, I have  a pink
                lemon tree in my apartment. And no, it does not have lemons...yet! I also enjoy baking, pretending to know how to play my ukulele, and working on
                side projects with my friends.
